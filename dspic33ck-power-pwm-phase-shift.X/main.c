 * PWM Complementary Output PWM Configuration Example
 * 
 * Description:
 * 
 *   This code example shows the basic configuration of two sychronized, phase shifted  
 *   PWM generator channels. The initial phase shift between PWM generator 
 *   channel 1 and 3 after startup is set to 90 degrees.By pressing push button [USER], 
 *   the phase shift is stepped to 180 degrees. Bypressing [USER] again, the phase shift  
 *   switches back to 90 degrees.Both channels are configured in complementary output mode. 
 *   The frequency and duty ratio of two PWM channels will always remain to 200Khz and 50% respectively
 * 
 * Please note:
 *   This code example can be run on dsPIC33CK as well as on dsPIC33CH
 *   devices. The PWM outputs of each device may be routed to different 
 *   test points. Please refer to the table below to quickly find the 
 *   right signal outputs. 
 * 
 * Recommended Use of this example:
 *   In this example Microchip Code Configurator (MCC) is used to set 
 *   up the device main and auxiliary clock as well as Timer1 used
 *   to create a deterministic execution of code within the main() 
 *   loop.The project folder 'common' contains generic PWM module 
 *   driver files,which are independent from MCC to better demonstrate 
 *   the PWM generator register configuration in more detail. 
 *   These driver files are providing an abstraction layer of the 
 *   user code, allowing quick migration of code across different 
 *   device peripherals and device families.
 * 
 *   To better understand these mechanisms please open file 'pwm.h' on
 *   code line 49 and change the following PWM generator index number to
 *   configure another PWM generator than #1 or #3.
 *
 *     #define MOTHER_PWM_GENERATOR   1 
 *     #define CHILD_PWM_GENERATOR    3 
 * 
 *   Valid numbers are 1-8 for PG1 through PG8 on dsPIC33CK and 
 *   1-4 for PG1 through PG4 on dsPIC33CH. Due to hardware limitations
 *   not all PWM generator outputs may be accessible. Please refer to 
 *   the Test Pin table below to review if the selected PWM generator 
 *   outputs are available and accessible.

 *  - Digital Power Development Board (DM330029) 
 *  - dsPIC33CK Digital Power Plug-In Module (MA330048)

 *  - MPLAB X IDE, v5.40
