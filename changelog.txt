### Release Highlights
This is the initial release demonstrating the basic configuration of a high-resolution PWM generator of the dsPIC33C family of devices.
This example is part of a series of code examples highlighting specific operating modes and features.

### Features Added\Updated
In this intial version the on-board LED of the dsPIC33CK Digital Power Plug-In Module is toggled with a interval Ã¼period of 300 ms, when the controller is running at maximum speed of 100 MIPS.
After startup, 90 degrees phase shift will be generated between pwm generator #1 and pwm generator #3. By pressing the on-board push button *USER* on the Digital Power Develpoment Board, the phase shift is toggled between the initial 90 degrees and 180 degrees.
